I recently had the opportunity of being in the back seat of a carpool on the way to hang out with friends. While I never had (and normally don't) have any reservations about how good the driving was, I was intrigued about what was being said (and probably thought) during the ride. One set of comments got me thinking about how we think about other drivers when driving, while another set of comments got me thinking about speed limits and the typical speed of cars around us.
