title: Glaciers versus Sea Ice

I recently had to do a quiz where one of the questions was indirectly asking about sea ice and glaciers, which I have some research experience in.

[:Glaciers](#glossary)

versus

[:Sea Ice](#SI)



# :x glossary
A large mass of ice formed under two conditions:
1. Ice mass has a positive [:mass balance](#massbalance)
2. Ice mass [:moves](#glaciermotion) under its own weight

The first condition is one of climate and weather where the ice mass is located. The second condition is about the size of the ice mass.

## :x accumulation
The combined set of processes that increases the mass of a glacier. This is typically mainly from snowfall, followed by the slow process of [:snow being compressed into ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firn).

## :x ablation
The combined set of processes that decrease the mass of a glacier. This includes [:melting](#melting) and runoff, calving, and sublimation.

## :x mass balance
The mass balance of a glacier is a calculation that computes the net change in mass of a glacier using net [:accumulation](#accumulation) and net [:ablation](#ablation).

A positive mass balance means the accumulation over winter is larger than the ablation over summer. This is required for an ice mass to naturally form and persist between years.

## :x glacier motion
As an ice mass grows in size, the [:force of gravity](#gravity) on it also increases which can lead to movement in two distinct ways:
1. [:Basal](#glacierbed) sliding down a slope can occur when gravity is large enough to overcome underlying friction, which can also be affected by [:lubrication by melted ice](#subglacial)
2. Internal deformation can occur when gravity creates large enough internal forces allowing the glacier to behave like a viscous fluid, since ice is a [:viscoelastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscoelasticity) material

## :x glacier bed
The base or bed of a glacier is the bottom of the ice, where it [:interacts with the ground beneath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-shaped_valley).

## :x glacial hydrology
Glacial hydrology is the study of how water flows through glaciers. It can be broken down into how water moves between three distinct parts of a glacier. From the top to the bottom of a glacier, they are: [:supraglacial hydrology](#supraglacial), [:englacial hydrology](#englacial), and [:subglacial hydrology](#subglacial).

## :x supraglacial
Supraglacial hydrology is all the processes that affect how water moves above a glacier. It is one part of the three-way breakdown of [:glacial hydrology](#glacialhydrology).

## :x englacial
Englacial hydrology is all the processes that affect how water moves inside a glacier. It is one part of the three-way breakdown of [:glacial hydrology](#glacialhydrology).

## :x subglacial
Subglacial hydrology is all the processes that affect how water moves [:beneath a glacier](#glacierbed). It is one part of the three-way breakdown of [:glacial hydrology](#glacialhydrology).

## :x gravity
Gravity is one of the [:four fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction#Overview_of_the_fundamental_interactions) of the universe. It is the attraction between all objects which is proportional to the mass of both objects and the distance between them.



## :x SI
Sea ice is the ice formed by [:freezing](#freezing) seawater. It floats on top of seawater as [:ice is less dense than water](#icedensity). At low enough temperatures, sea ice will start freezing into [:small ice crystals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_ice), which under rough conditions may [:unevenly clump together]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_ice)), to eventually form a solid, connected layer. Further freezing increases the thickness of the sea ice layer, growing from the bottom downwards.

Sea ice is typically classified between first year ice, which has formed within the current season, and old ice, which has formed in a previous winter season and has survived at least one summer season. This classification is important because old ice starts the winter season already formed and has a head start in growth, so can be much thicker than first year ice. The thickness is then directly related to sea ice's [:flexural strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexural_strength), load bearing capacity, and impact on offshore structures.

## :x freezing
Freezing is a [:phase transition](#phasetransition) when a liquid becomes solid. The opposite is [:melting](#melting).

## :x melting
Melting is a [:phase transition](#phasetransition) when a solid becomes liquid The opposite is [:freezing](#freezing).

## :x phase transition
A phase transition is the physical change of matter between [:states](#matterstate). A typical phase transition occurs when a substance reaches a temperature and pressure that corresponds to a [:phase boundary](#phaseboundary). Any additional energy change in the substance will go into a [:latent heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat) instead of changing temperature or pressure, until the phase transition is complete.

## :x matter state
The basic states of matter are solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. For a specific substance, each state corresponds to an independent range of temperature and pressure, which is commonly portrayed via a [:phase diagram](#phasediagram).

## :x phase diagram
A phase diagram of a substance is a plot of pressure versus temperature with regions that correspond to [:states](#matterstate) the substance can be in. The regions show all the combinations of temperature and pressure for the substance to remain in the corresponding state. The edges of the regions correspond to [:phase boundaries](#phaseboundary).

## :x phase boundary
A phase boundary of a substance is the limit of temperature and pressure where a [:phase transition](#phasetransition) will start occuring. A triple point is a unique phase boundary where three [:states](#matterstate) can coexist simultaneously.

## :x ice density
Unusually for a substance, ice (solid) is less dense than water (liquid). This is due to the [:close arrangement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond) of free-flowing liquid water molecules compared to the open, [:packed arrangement of water molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Ih) in a solid [:lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure). This means that the ice-water [:phase boundary](#phaseboundary) has a negative slope, meaning at a fixed temperature, you can melt ice by increasing its pressure.
