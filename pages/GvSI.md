I recently had to do a quiz where one of the questions was indirectly asking about sea ice and glaciers, which I have some research experience in.

[:Glaciers](#glossary)

versus

[:Sea Ice](#SI)


# :x glossary
A large mass of ice formed under two conditions:
1. Ice mass has a positive [:mass balance](#massbalance)
2. Ice mass [:moves](#glaciermotion) under its own weight

The first condition is one of climate and weather where the ice mass is located. For an ice mass to naturally form and persist between years, the [:accumulation](#accumulation) over winter should be larger than the [:ablation](#ablation) over summer. The second condition is about the size of the ice mass. A large ice mass which experiences a large enough [:gravitational force](#gravity) can begin to [:move in two distinct ways](#glaciermotion).

## :x accumulation
The combined set of processes that increase the mass of a glacier. This is typically and mainly from snowfall, followed by the slow process of snow being compressed into ice.

## :x ablation
The combined set of processes that decrease the mass of a glacier. This includes melting and runoff, calving, and sublimation.

## :x mass balance
The mass balance of a glacier is a calculation that computes the net change in mass of a glacier using net [:accumulation](#accumulation) and net [:ablation](#ablation).

## :x glacier motion
As an ice mass grows in size, the force of gravity on it also increases which can lead to movement in two distinct ways. The first type of movement is [:basal](#glacierbed) sliding when [:gravity](#gravity) is large enough to overcome underlying friction, which can be assisted with [:lubrication by melted ice](#subglacial). The second type of movement is internal deformation, since ice is a [:viscoelastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscoelasticity) material and can behave like a viscous fluid under large enough internal forces due to gravity.

## :x glacier bed
The base or bed of a glacier is the bottom of the ice, where it interacts with the ground beneath.

## :x glacial hydrology
Glacial hydrology is the study of how water flows through glaciers. It can be broken down into how water moves between three distinct parts of a glacier. From the top to the bottom of a glacier, they are: [:supraglacial hydrology](#supraglacial), [:englacial hydrology](#englacial), and [:subglacial hydrology](#subglacial).

## :x supraglacial
Supraglacial hydrology is all the processes that affect how water moves above a glacier. It is one part of the three-way breakdown of [:glacial hydrology](#glacialhydrology).

## :x englacial
Englacial hydrology is all the processes that affect how water moves inside a glacier. It is one part of the three-way breakdown of [:glacial hydrology](#glacialhydrology).

## :x subglacial
Subglacial hydrology is all the processes that affect how water moves [:beneath a glacier](#glacierbed). It is one part of the three-way breakdown of [:glacial hydrology](#glacialhydrology).

## :x gravity
Gravity is one of the [:four fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction#Overview_of_the_fundamental_interactions) of the universe. It is the attraction between all objects which is proportional to the mass of both objects and the distance between them.


## :x SI
Sea ice is the ice formed by [:freezing](#freezing) seawater. It floats on top of seawater as ice is less dense than water. It is started by the atmosphere being cold enough to cool the surface seawater below its freezing point. This is followed by small ice crystals forming to reach [:grease ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_ice), which under rough conditions may start clumping together to form [:pancake ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_ice), and eventually one solid, connected layer.

Sea ice is typically classified between first year ice, which has formed within the current season, and old ice, which has formed in a previous winter season and has survived at least one summer season. This is because old ice can be much thicker than first year ice, increasing its [:flexural strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexural_strength).

## :x freezing
Freezing is a [:phase transition](#phasetransition) when a liquid becomes solid. The opposite is [:melting](#melting).

## :x melting
Melting is a [:phase transition](#phasetransition) when a solid becomes liquid The opposite is [:freezing](#freezing).

## :x phase transition
A phase transition is the physical change of matter between [:states](#matterstate). A typical phase transition occurs when a substance reaches a temperature and pressure that corresponds to a [:phase boundary](#phaseboundary). Any additional energy change in the substance will go into a [:latent heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_heat) instead of changing temperature or pressure, until the phase transition is complete.

## :x matter state
The basic states of matter are solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. They correspond to specific ranges of temperature and pressure unique to a substance, which is commonly portrayed via a [:phase diagram](#phasediagram).
